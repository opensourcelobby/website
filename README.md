## **advocacy** for sustenance of Free/Libre and Open Source Software

**opensourcelobby** is a movement to advocate for fair and sustained support of Open Source Software. We believe that if powerful corporations can lobby for their private interests, there must also be people - across industry, academia, and policy who lobby for the public good of self-reliant and community-driven technology.

We want to help you take concrete actions to strengthen the FOSS ecosystem through funding, adoption, and advocacy.

The project is currently in its formative phase. This site is an initial draft. Please reach out if have any ideas to rally support for a $9 trillion resource that companies take for granted.
