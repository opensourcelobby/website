            <h2><b>advocacy</b> for sustenance of Free/Libre and Open Source Software</h2>
            <p><b>opensourcelobby</b> is a movement to advocate for fair and sustained support of Open Source Software.
                We believe that if powerful corporations can lobby for their private interests, there must also be people -
                 across industry, academia, and policy who lobby for the public good of self-reliant and community-driven technology.
            </p>
            <p>We want to help you take concrete actions to strengthen the FOSS ecosystem through funding, adoption, and advocacy.</p>
